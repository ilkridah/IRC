IRC, or Internet Relay Chat, is a protocol for real-time communication over the internet. It allows users to join channels (chat rooms) and participate in discussions. Here are some key points about IRC:

 * Channels: Users can join channels (like #example), where they can chat with others on specific topics.
 * Clients: There are many IRC clients available, such as mIRC, HexChat, and Pidgin, which allow users to connect to IRC servers.
 * Commands: IRC uses specific commands for actions, like /join to enter a channel, /msg to send private messages, and /nick to change your nickname.
 * Servers: IRC operates on servers that host channels and manage connections. Popular networks include Freenode (now Libera Chat) and EFNet.
 * Real-time Communication: It's designed for real-time interaction, making it suitable for both casual chats and more organized discussions.
